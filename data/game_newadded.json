    "Description": "In Stonehearth, you pioneer a living world full of warmth, heroism, and mystery. Help a small group of settlers build a home for themselves in a forgotten land. You\u2019ll need to establish a food supply, build shelter, defend your people, monitor their moods, and find a way to grow and expand, facing challenges at every step. <br><br>Starting from procedurally generated terrain with dynamic AI encounters, Stonehearth combines community management and combat with infinite building possibilities. It\u2019s designed to be moddable at every level, from your city to the people and creatures inhabiting the world, and will ship with the tools and documentation for you to add your own customizations to the game, and share them with friends.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build and Grow Your City</h2><br>The heart of the game is city building and management. When you're just starting out, you'll need to juggle tasks like obtaining a sustainable food supply, building shelter, and defending your fledgling settlement from raiders and other threats. <br><br>Once you've achieved a foothold in the world, it's up to you to write the destiny for your people. You have the flexibility to choose your own path in this game. Do you want to build a great conquering empire? A vibrant trade city? A spiritual monastery? We really want you to feel like this is your settlement, and give you the tools that make it look and operate exactly as you wish.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Level Up Your Settlers</h2><br>All the settlers in your towns have jobs. A job is like a class in a role playing game. Each job has a specific role like hauling materials, building, crafting, and fighting. As your hearthlings work at a job they will gain experience and levels. Some jobs, when they meet certain prerequisites, can upgrade to entirely new jobs with new capabilities.<br><br>Usually, to assign someone a new job you'll also need to craft a tool for them. The Mason can craft blocks, statues, and tools from stone, but to do it he'll need a mallet and chisel crafted by the carpenter. Our goal is to have a job tree that's both very wide and very deep, so there will be plenty of different kinds of things to do in the game, but also a lot of depth to explore if you want to concentrate on any one area.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Player Driven Legacy Through Modding</h2><br>We LOVE mods and want to make it as easy as possible to author and share mods. <br><br>Want to see a new kind of sword in the game? You can model it, define its stats, and then craft it in game. You can also share the design with other players so they can enjoy it too, or bring their authored content into your game. <br><br>As a modder you\u2019ll be able to do basically anything that we as developers can do: introduce new items and monsters, write new scripted adventures, influence the AI, you name it. It goes back to that original pen and paper RPG experience, where \u201cthe game\u201d is a collaboration between the core ruleset and the stories crafted by the gamemaster."

    "Description": "<strong>NoLimits 2</strong> is the ultimate roller coaster simulation that lets you experience authentic roller coaster thrills. Climb into the world's most famous roller coasters and experience the excitement in real time. Or design a new roller coaster that is engineered to your specifications. <br><br>Use a full-featured roller coaster editor with a CAD-style wire-frame display to build a custom coaster. Drag and drop track, supporting structures, and other objects. Use slider bars to change the perspective of the elements being designed, and to zoom in and out. Your only constraints are the laws of physics and your imagination. <br><br>After you have designed and constructed your roller coaster, <strong>NoLimits 2</strong> serves up a real-time roller coaster experience, from the time the train chugs its way up the first slope, to the time it stops to a stop on the exit platform. The simulation includes the sounds of the wind rushing by, and the metal-on-metal sounds that are integral to enjoying a coaster ride. It's easy to choose any seat on any car in the coaster train. Use the computer's mouse to change the line of sight and angle of vision. <br><br><strong>NoLimits 2</strong> is the world's most comprehensive roller coaster simulation, with results so realistic that professional designers like <i>John Wardley</i> use <strong>NoLimits 2</strong> to create and test designs for physical roller coasters.

You are the lord of life and death now - and you have full control over the lives of worthless human scum.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will also run, you will need to think, you will need to hide and fight back when armed forces come to take you down.

For this reason we decided to give you the possibility to <strong>get the soundtracks on your own devices and listen to them more often</strong> than while sniping in Georgia.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Composed and produced by <strong>Mikolai Stroinski </strong>(The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt \u2013 Blood and Wine, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Detached, Kursk), mixed by <strong>Steve Kempster</strong> and recorded by <strong>Tony Phillips</strong> at <strong>Beautiful Noise Studios in Los Angeles</strong>, each artist was invited to the studio to provide his or her own element to the overall score. Some instruments used that may be familiar to a Western audience include drum, bass, synthesizer, guitar and vocals; but, there\u2019s also the use of mandolin, balalaika and bandura.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Artists involved include:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf\tVocals - Aurelia Shrenker</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf\tGuitars, Balalaika, Bandura, Mandolin - George Bernhardt</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf\tSynthesizers - Mikolai Stroinski</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf\tBass - Paul Bushnell</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf\tDrum Set - Joel Taylor </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Some songs on the soundtrack have a noticeable Georgian touch to them, and a fair amount of Sniper Ghost Warrior 3\u2019s score is<strong> inspired by various folk and pop music</strong> researched prior to the pre-production of the game score. The goal in mind for the <strong>Georgian-influenced songs</strong> are to enhance the player\u2019s emotions and to emphasize the location in Georgia while also leaving the location to be painted by other elements in the game such as the graphics and dialogue. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/368070/extras/soundtrack-min.png?t=1728377817\" /></p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 tells the story of brotherhood, faith and betrayal in the most complete sniper experience ever.

Customize weapon equipment, accessories, vehicles and a drone, and utilize the three pillars of gameplay to your liking: Sniper, Ghost and Warrior.<br><br>Go behind enemy lines with the ultimate modern military shooter. Play as an American sniper dropped in Georgia, near Russian border. Choose your own path to accomplish your missions across an unforgiving open world.<br><br><strong>Be a Sniper:</strong> Engage your targets from the long range.

But a skyscraper is more than just steel and glass, it\u2019s an intricate ecosystem, full of people that live and work in the building. They become a complex machine that needs your steady hand to keep it running smoothly and efficiently.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/423580/extras/header_residential-HR.jpg?t=1733140137\" /><br>From the moment you break ground, every decision rests with you. As the architect you must coordinate the construction of everything - every wall and wire, every office and apartment. As the building owner you must keep your tenants happy - and paying rent on time. As a savvy developer you must keep an eye on the bottom line and invest in the future. Succeed and you will reap the rewards of a prestigious address where everyone will clamor to live and work. Fail and you will watch tenants leave in disgust, taking their business elsewhere and leaving your reputation in tatters.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/423580/extras/header_restaurant-HR.jpg?t=1733140137\" /><br>Will you create an exclusive office highrise that attracts business leaders from around the world? Will you construct luxury apartments in the sky, penthouses for the elite and playgrounds for the famous?

Play with 4 players on one computer, or 4 players each at their own computers online, or any combination inbetween! Have one friend that can't make it to your game night?  No worries, you can play with 3 local players and 1 online player!<br><br></li><li><strong>30+ crazy minigames!</strong><br>Over 30 unique minigames!  Run, jump, and punch your way to first place!  Fight over gems, chase exploding chickens, play football with your face!  More minigames coming in future updates!<br><br></li><li><strong>The Gauntlet </strong><br>Race your friends through the deadly and brutal obstacle course that is the Gauntlet.   Can you be the first to make it through the giant swinging axes, spike traps and more?<br><br></li><li><strong>Board Game </strong><br>Due to popular request, Party Panic now has a board game mode.  Take turns hitting the dice and move your Goober around the board and collect the most trophies.  There are currently two boards, &quot;The Temple of Goob&quot;, and &quot;Willy's Pizza Party&quot;<br><br></li><li><strong>Bots </strong> <br>Party Panic is a hoot when playing with your friends on the couch or online, but sometimes this isn't an option. Bots are available to play against, to guarantee it's always a party, even when your friends are not around!  Bots have three difficulties: Easy, Normal, and Hard.  Or turn them off completely! <br><br></li><li><strong>Silly hats! </strong><br>Everyone knows all great games let you wear hats.  Silly hats only.  Wear a pot on your head, strap a rocket to your back, or a wear a hot dog costume.  Or just stick your head in a piece of bread. Whatever works.  \u1555( \u141b )\u1557<br><br></li><li><strong>Leveling System</strong><br>Every time you play you'll get XP used to unlock loot boxes.  Each loot box contains TWO costumes you do not yet own, of which you can choose one to keep!  Can you unlock them all?<br><br></li><li><strong>Lovable (but slightly deranged) characters </strong><br>In Party Panic you play as a Goober.  You're a goofy goober.  I'm a goofy goober.  We're all goofy goobers.  They're a little bit crazy though (probably from all the blunt force trauma to the head.)  They like to scream randomly.  Like a lot.<br><br></li><li><strong>Built-in drinking game! </strong><br>Enable it while configuring your game, the <i>party</i> into a <strong>party.</strong> Or don't, I'm not the boss of you!<br><br></li><li><strong>Original (awesome) soundtrack </strong><br>Party Panic sounds like a party.  Literally.  </li></ul><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/506500/extras/Faq.png?t=1573184475\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Can I play the game alone?</strong><br>Yes.  The game can be played with one player against bots, although the more human players you have the more fun the game is! All the party minigames are built around 4 players so it is recommended to leave bots enabled, however you don't have to - the bots can be disabled and the game can be played with 2-4 players.  <br><br><br></li><li><strong>Is there online multiplayer?</strong><br>Yes!  (As of October 14th, 2016)<br>More info about this here: <br><br></li><li><strong>Does it work with Steam Link, &amp; In-home streaming?</strong><br>Yes.  Some users have reported getting a black screen on startup, see how to fix this here: <br><br></li><li><strong>Do I have to use a controller?</strong><br>No, you don't <strong>have</strong> to, Party Panic can be played completely with a keyboard and mouse now!  If you want to use a controller, any usb or wireless controller+receiver should work.  You can customize your controls to find something that works best for you if you don't like the default keyboard configuration via the options menu. <br><br></li><li><strong>What languages?</strong><br>Party Panic has support for English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Italian, Turkish, and Russian.

To separate truth from illusion. To make sense of their own lives.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Steam version of SeaBed has been updated to natively support 1440x1080 resolution.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Characters:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/583090/extras/SB-Gif1.gif?t=1732731242\" /><i>&quot;At times, I'd wake up at night and hear all the sounds around me as if they were amplified. I'd feel like my head could burst at any second.&quot; </i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Although she moved to Tokyo straight after graduating university in order to seek employment, Mizuno Sachiko soon quit her job to establish Clover Design with her childhood friend Takako, becoming its young CEO. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Her main hobby is reading, but only because nothing else manages to interest her. Although Sachiko used to be quite an avid reader during her school years, finding a job means she now only opens a book every once in a while, whenever her schedule allows it. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After meeting Takako \u2013 an inexhaustible source of enthusiasm, as well as a stark contrast to her own personality \u2013 during her childhood years, Sachiko\u2019s interests began to shift to whatever the other woman was doing at a given time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/583090/extras/SB-Gif2.gif?t=1732731242\" /><i>&quot;This is as good a time as any, so let's check it out.&quot;</i> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Endlessly interested in and enthusiastic about the world, Takako gives the impression of a woman perpetually stuck in her childhood. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">She fell in love with Sachiko at first sight back when they first met at the age of five. However, she does not identify as a homosexual, stressing that Sachiko simply happened to be a woman. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Takako discovers that she suffers from developmental amnesia, a condition that severely impairs her ability to recall many of her memories.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/583090/extras/SB-Gif3.gif?t=1732731242\" /><i>&quot;I just like observing people.&quot; </i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A psychiatrist at Narasaki Mental Clinic. She was Sachiko's classmate and friend during her elementary school years, but the two drifted apart as they enrolled in different middle schools. After learning that Sachiko has been experiencing hallucinations, she takes it upon herself to treat her. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">She is extremely picky about her brand of coffee, perhaps because the beverage serves as her sole companion during those long hours spent immersed in research. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Though not religious, she is a strong believer that everything happens for a reason, and all things have their place and order in the grand scheme of the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/583090/extras/sb4.png?t=1732731242\" /></p>"

Check out the <strong>Steam Workshop</strong> to see the available language packs created by other players!</p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Grey Hack is a massively multiplayer hacking simulator game.<br><br>You're a hacker with full freedom to act as you wish on a vast network of procedurally generated computers.<br><br>File Explorer, Terminal and Text Editor are some of the programs that will be available from the start of the game. As you improve your skills you will find new utilities that you may install and use.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/605230/extras/anim01c.gif?t=1737536381\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A living persistent world</h2>Explore the Grey Hack universe and forge your own reputation in a world shared by all players. When you leave the game, <strong>the online universe remains actively running 24/7</strong>.<br><br>This always active game session means that the changes you have made in any computer in the world can be seen by players who connect to them even if you are no longer online. Your progress will be saved, but your actions may have consequences.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plan your attacks</h2>Each network in the world has a totally different configuration, size and security, also using a dynamic and deep exploit system so that each network and computer poses a different challenge. Study your target; use social engineering, scan the system for administrator flaws that allow a backdoor to be opened, test different possible exploits, but above all, cover your tracks when you're done.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Create, modify, share</h2>The terminal has a fundamental role, based on real UNIX commands; it is an indispensable tool for carrying out successful attacks.<br><br>Terminal commands and exploits have been built using the scripting language available in the game, this means that you can modify any existing command or create your own if you wish. In the same way you can create your own exploits if the ones that are already available in the world do not satisfy your needs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sandbox</h2>Grey Hack offers a non-linear experience where you progress at your own pace. Publish web pages to share your creations, create guilds and organize attacks against other players, carry out commissioned missions to earn money and reputation, or explore the world on your own where special missions and other secrets are hidden.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Single Player Mode</h2>Grey Hack is intended to be played in Multiplayer Mode, benefiting from the richer environment of an always-online universe, but the game also offers a single player mode for those so inclined. In Single Player mode, you play in a world created on your computer. Unlike Online Mode, when you exit the game in Single Player, the in-game universe stops, and progress resumes only upon your return.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Roadmap</h2>Grey Hack is in the Alpha phase version 0.8. You can check the roadmap on the game's Steam forum. I am open for suggestions, if there is any feature you would like to see in the game, do not hesitate to let me know through the Steam forums or Discord."

You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion.

You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.).

It is also the main idea on which Neighbours back From Hell is built. A whole TV show based on playing increasingly outrageous pranks on your grumpy neighbor to keep the audience entertained, and viewership numbers high. It\u2019s good to be bad in this early 2000s trash TV-inspired slapstick extravaganza! <br><br>As Woody, the vengeful star protagonist of Neighbours back From Hell, you will prank your way through Seasons 1 and 2 of the fictitious, but aptly named TV show. Take the mischief from your nasty neighbor\u2019s flat all the way to China, India, and Mexico where you will make sure his holiday is a living hell. While you\u2019re at it, why limit targeting your antics at your neighbor, when you can involve his mother and fellow travelers? Whatever you decide to do, your trusty camera crew will be right there and keep a keen eye on all the action. You can let your crooked creativity flow freely and watch the neighbor rage in desperation. Just be mindful not to get caught by him or his companions, or they will whoop you good and your TV show will be taken off the air. If you perform well on the other hand, by creating more and more disarray and chaos in the neighbor\u2019s life, ratings will increase, and you could win prestigious awards. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1283190/extras/NBFH_chars_600x200.png?t=1732705971\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Neighbours from Hell 1 &amp; 2 Remastered in one package: 25 episodes set in the neighbour\u2019s home, on a cruise liner, and in several different holiday locations around the world<br></li><li>All graphics newly rendered in Full HD<br></li><li>Framerate of all animations doubled for a smoother experience <br></li><li>Use stealth, skill and style to perform the perfect ambush<br></li><li>Easy to use interface and controls<br></li><li>Superb cartoon-style graphics<br></li><li>Big band soundtrack</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1283190/extras/TV2.gif?t=1732705971\" />"

Captaining your extraordinary ship, raise the mast, hoist and angle the sails, light the furnace and more as you learn to sail the ocean while mourning the loss of your home.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SOUNDS OF THE OCEAN</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1570010/extras/1760752280_Far_Launch_Trailer_GIF_01.gif?t=1736517547\" /><br>A dynamic soundtrack reacts to player and environmental actions, amplifying key moments in the game and heightening the atmosphere, meaning pulse pounding crescendos, serene moments of reflection and everything in between are created by, rather than scripted for, the player."

Additionally, the experience is designed with singleplayer and multiplayer in mind.<br><br><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br>- You only need to find one normal station to escape.<br><br>- If the station is as you remembered, exit the station, or else get back on the train.<br><br>- Take your time, remember the station... and don't forget it... something lurks in the tunnels...<br><br>- Hidden in plain sight. The anomalies are not subtle, but you need to pay attention.<br><br>- The station is small, but the anomalies are random and numerous.<br><br>- No cheap jumpscares. As long as you're paying attention of course...<br><br>- But you need to stay alert, avoid any strange beings in the stations, and avoid... the Anomaly Exit!<br><br><strong>CO-OP MULTIPLAYER</strong><br>The station is scary on your own, so team up with other passengers to try and help to remember your way out of the station together! Or you can go your separate ways, and see who makes it out alive.<br><br><strong>PROXIMITY VOICE CHAT</strong><br>Keep your fellow passengers in shouting distance, or you won't know what may happen to them in the other room...<br><br>This is a memory based game. So take your time, be patient, no quick reflexes required.<br>A headset is highly recommended!<br>Average playtime: 0.5 to 1.5 hours.<br><br>Come join the Discord, I would love to hear your thoughts/feedback if you have any!<br>"

It's a game where you find them and capture a photo with a camera.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2753720/extras/example.jpg?t=1727098297\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Two Modes</h2>There are two modes: Normal Mode and Nightmare Mode.<br>In Normal Mode, an anomaly will always occur at each time.<br>However, in Nightmare Mode, there are instances where no anomaly occurs. Is it that there are no anomaly, or is it simply that you haven't been discovered yet?<br>I recommend starting with the normal mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Playtime and content size</h2>The expected playtime to clear the normal mode once is approximately 20 minutes to 1 hour and a half. It would take more than three hours to capture all anomalies. There will be a total of 81 anomalies occurring.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Save Data</h2>Even if you stop the game midway, the anomalies you've captured are saved. However, please be aware that anomalies discovered using the radio (helping item) are not saved, so please be cautious.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">If the Game Crashes</h2>There are reports that updating the graphics card driver to the latest version resolves crashes.<br>Additionally, it may not work without a driver that supports DirectX12.<br>insufficient graphics card memory could also be considered as one of the causes. Please try reducing the graphics quality from the settings menu.<br>If it still does not work, please proceed with a refund.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Videos and Streaming</h2>Feel free to publish gameplay videos or stream the game without contacting the developer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">For Those Prone to Motion Sickness in 3D</h2>Adjust the following settings in the configuration menu:<br>- Set the &quot;Head Bob&quot; slider to 0.<br>- Set the &quot;Motion Blur&quot; slider to 0.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Recommended Graphics Settings</h2>Setting the Global Illumination to &quot;High&quot; or higher enhances the game's atmosphere thanks to UE5's Lumen feature. However, be aware that this can significantly strain your GPU, potentially resulting in slower performance.<br><br>If your FPS (Frames per Second) is low, consider lowering the graphics settings. After starting the game, pause it to see the FPS displayed in the top left corner. The FPS is adjusted in-game to range from 22 to 62.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2753720/extras/hosoku_en.jpg?t=1727098297\" />"

This is Kunyu Technology, a group of middle-aged men and gentlemen born in the 1990s and 1980s who have little love experience and have not much hair. They are so tired of playing games and really want to have a sweet relationship. With this idea in mind, we have launched a side quest called &quot;Together with our current friends, give benefits to the player master&quot;.<br><br>  &quot;Let's create a real-life dating game that makes people's hearts flutter together!&quot; This was a simple idea that brought together three teams with expertise in different fields: Yiran Films, Juhuo Culture, and Kunyu Technology.<br><br>  Yiran Films, the initiator of this collision, provided the original creative seed and is responsible for the visual presentation of the game. Despite being a well-established film company, Yiran has a strong internal gaming gene \u2013 a veteran otaku director, a producer with a game major in college, and a producer who enthusiastically explores various games. This creative endeavor finally allows these &quot;misguided&quot; filmmakers to return to the right path and release their long-held passion!<br><br>  Juhuo Culture is responsible for character design and story writing. After years of deep involvement in traditional film and television, they eagerly anticipated the opportunity to dance closely with the gaming industry, and fortunately, &quot;The Heartbeat of Them&quot; came along. With absolute sincerity, Juhuo participated in the content creation of the game, believing that the desire for good content shines brightly across any medium. They also hope that the emotional resonance from Juhuo can resonate with users.<br><br>  Our team is &quot;complicated,&quot; with straight men, straight women, and sexual minorities. However, our confusion about love is surprisingly similar. We talk about the wonderful experiences of love like a virus - chaotic, sweet, impactful, yet filled with the bitterness of regret. No one can explain or even understand the confusion itself.<br><br>  In the end, we chose to capture the beautiful side of love, gathering those heart-pounding moments. When you open it, you can be a blank canvas or silently recite a name in your heart (we won't stop you from reciting a hundred names), then embark on a journey. If you can immerse yourself in it, it would be our great honor. If you're facing challenges in real-life relationships, we hope this game can briefly rekindle your courage in love.<br><br>  Consider this a &quot;love letter&quot; dedicated to love itself. We write it for those falling in love or peering from the shore, for those throwing stones at themselves in love, for those unable to send letters, and for those not receiving replies.<br><br>  Remember, love allows us to imagine beyond destiny. We can mock the naivety of such thoughts, but don't give up on sending waves of love to the world \u2013 biu~"
