    "Description": "In Stonehearth, you pioneer a living world full of warmth, heroism, and mystery. Help a small group of settlers build a home for themselves in a forgotten land. You\u2019ll need to establish a food supply, build shelter, defend your people, monitor their moods, and find a way to grow and expand, facing challenges at every step. <br><br>Starting from procedurally generated terrain with dynamic AI encounters, Stonehearth combines community management and combat with infinite building possibilities. It\u2019s designed to be moddable at every level, from your city to the people and creatures inhabiting the world, and will ship with the tools and documentation for you to add your own customizations to the game, and share them with friends.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build and Grow Your City</h2><br>The heart of the game is city building and management. When you're just starting out, you'll need to juggle tasks like obtaining a sustainable food supply, building shelter, and defending your fledgling settlement from raiders and other threats. <br><br>Once you've achieved a foothold in the world, it's up to you to write the destiny for your people. You have the flexibility to choose your own path in this game. Do you want to build a great conquering empire? A vibrant trade city? A spiritual monastery? We really want you to feel like this is your settlement, and give you the tools that make it look and operate exactly as you wish.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Level Up Your Settlers</h2><br>All the settlers in your towns have jobs. A job is like a class in a role playing game. Each job has a specific role like hauling materials, building, crafting, and fighting. As your hearthlings work at a job they will gain experience and levels. Some jobs, when they meet certain prerequisites, can upgrade to entirely new jobs with new capabilities.<br><br>Usually, to assign someone a new job you'll also need to craft a tool for them. The Mason can craft blocks, statues, and tools from stone, but to do it he'll need a mallet and chisel crafted by the carpenter. Our goal is to have a job tree that's both very wide and very deep, so there will be plenty of different kinds of things to do in the game, but also a lot of depth to explore if you want to concentrate on any one area.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Player Driven Legacy Through Modding</h2><br>We LOVE mods and want to make it as easy as possible to author and share mods. <br><br>Want to see a new kind of sword in the game? You can model it, define its stats, and then craft it in game. You can also share the design with other players so they can enjoy it too, or bring their authored content into your game. <br><br>As a modder you\u2019ll be able to do basically anything that we as developers can do: introduce new items and monsters, write new scripted adventures, influence the AI, you name it. It goes back to that original pen and paper RPG experience, where \u201cthe game\u201d is a collaboration between the core ruleset and the stories crafted by the gamemaster."

To separate truth from illusion. To make sense of their own lives.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Steam version of SeaBed has been updated to natively support 1440x1080 resolution.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Characters:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/583090/extras/SB-Gif1.gif?t=1732731242\" /><i>&quot;At times, I'd wake up at night and hear all the sounds around me as if they were amplified.

Although Sachiko used to be quite an avid reader during her school years, finding a job means she now only opens a book every once in a while, whenever her schedule allows it. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After meeting Takako \u2013 an inexhaustible source of enthusiasm, as well as a stark contrast to her own personality \u2013 during her childhood years, Sachiko\u2019s interests began to shift to whatever the other woman was doing at a given time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/583090/extras/SB-Gif2.gif?t=1732731242\" /><i>&quot;This is as good a time as any, so let's check it out.&quot;</i> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Endlessly interested in and enthusiastic about the world, Takako gives the impression of a woman perpetually stuck in her childhood. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">She fell in love with Sachiko at first sight back when they first met at the age of five. However, she does not identify as a homosexual, stressing that Sachiko simply happened to be a woman. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Takako discovers that she suffers from developmental amnesia, a condition that severely impairs her ability to recall many of her memories.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/583090/extras/SB-Gif3.gif?t=1732731242\" /><i>&quot;I just like observing people.&quot; </i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A psychiatrist at Narasaki Mental Clinic.

After learning that Sachiko has been experiencing hallucinations, she takes it upon herself to treat her. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">She is extremely picky about her brand of coffee, perhaps because the beverage serves as her sole companion during those long hours spent immersed in research. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Though not religious, she is a strong believer that everything happens for a reason, and all things have their place and order in the grand scheme of the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/583090/extras/sb4.png?t=1732731242\" /></p>"

Check out the <strong>Steam Workshop</strong> to see the available language packs created by other players!</p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Grey Hack is a massively multiplayer hacking simulator game.<br><br>You're a hacker with full freedom to act as you wish on a vast network of procedurally generated computers.<br><br>File Explorer, Terminal and Text Editor are some of the programs that will be available from the start of the game. As you improve your skills you will find new utilities that you may install and use.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/605230/extras/anim01c.gif?t=1737536381\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A living persistent world</h2>Explore the Grey Hack universe and forge your own reputation in a world shared by all players. When you leave the game, <strong>the online universe remains actively running 24/7</strong>.<br><br>This always active game session means that the changes you have made in any computer in the world can be seen by players who connect to them even if you are no longer online. Your progress will be saved, but your actions may have consequences.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plan your attacks</h2>Each network in the world has a totally different configuration, size and security, also using a dynamic and deep exploit system so that each network and computer poses a different challenge. Study your target; use social engineering, scan the system for administrator flaws that allow a backdoor to be opened, test different possible exploits, but above all, cover your tracks when you're done.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Create, modify, share</h2>The terminal has a fundamental role, based on real UNIX commands; it is an indispensable tool for carrying out successful attacks.<br><br>Terminal commands and exploits have been built using the scripting language available in the game, this means that you can modify any existing command or create your own if you wish. In the same way you can create your own exploits if the ones that are already available in the world do not satisfy your needs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sandbox</h2>Grey Hack offers a non-linear experience where you progress at your own pace. Publish web pages to share your creations, create guilds and organize attacks against other players, carry out commissioned missions to earn money and reputation, or explore the world on your own where special missions and other secrets are hidden.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Single Player Mode</h2>Grey Hack is intended to be played in Multiplayer Mode, benefiting from the richer environment of an always-online universe, but the game also offers a single player mode for those so inclined. In Single Player mode, you play in a world created on your computer. Unlike Online Mode, when you exit the game in Single Player, the in-game universe stops, and progress resumes only upon your return.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Roadmap</h2>Grey Hack is in the Alpha phase version 0.8. You can check the roadmap on the game's Steam forum. I am open for suggestions, if there is any feature you would like to see in the game, do not hesitate to let me know through the Steam forums or Discord."

You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion.

There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861650/extras/SESS_GIF_03_VideoTape.gif?t=1734627429\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861650/extras/EN_3.png?t=1734627429\" /><br><br>Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen\u2026 In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861650/extras/SESS_GIF_04_CustomSkate.gif?t=1734627429\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861650/extras/EN_4.png?t=1734627429\" /><br><br>Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard.
