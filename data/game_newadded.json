Now with full controller support, Steam trading cards and backgrounds, new specimens, the ability to toggle between the old and new specimen visuals, and Oculus Rift and Vive support. This new version of Spooky\u2019s will also have Endless Mode and all DLC bundled together. This new game will also have a \u201CBuild Your Own Mansion\u201D feature integrating with Steam Workshop. There will be both tools in the game to edit rooms and a development SDK that allows players to create new specimen, mechanics, and whatever they desire and share them on the Workshop!\u003Cbr /\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\r\nWHY THIS IS A NEW GAME:\u003Cbr /\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\r\nAs you might know the original Spooky\u0027s Jump Scare Mansion was written in GameMaker 8 - which only has the most rudimentary of 3D support. In order to add features like 3D specimens, VR, Mac \u0026amp; Linux ports, and to fix a lot of the nagging issues (like getting stuck on corners) and other much-requested features it has to be rewritten from the ground up! We\u0027re taking this opportunity to add all that and more in Unity - which is a modern fully featured natively 3D engine that is a lot easier to work with for this kind of game than old GameMaker.",
