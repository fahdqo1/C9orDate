Craft weapons, armor and elixirs before venturing into the Withered Lands and battle bloodthirsty Withered monsters, gradually ridding the island of the Withered plague.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">INVITE FRIENDS TO YOUR ISLAND</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you build your villages and grow your ecosystems how you want, it’s time to show them off!

        "Description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Welcome to Zerzura</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">During the Last War, the thriving metropolis Zerzura was almost obliterated in a war between AGIs (Artificial General Intelligence). As Zerzura City is known to host the mausoleum of the last functional AGI, an Exclusion Zone has been established around the ruins of the city by the mega-corporations - ostensibly to safeguard the public against rampaging AGI-forged anomalies, but also to ensure the corporations have the first pick of precious salvage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181950/extras/BossHeaderCropped.gif?t=1732263276\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Assemble Your Crew</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181950/extras/CharSelectCropped.gif?t=1732263276\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Assemble your crew of 3 from 9 steadfast operators, split into 3 core archetypes: Guardian, Assault, and Specialist. Choose to field a classic party with one of each archetype, or mix things up with unconventional compositions. Any combination is viable, provided you have the skill to guide them through the trials of Zerzura City. There is no true protagonist in this game: with the right cards and augmentations, any operator can have their turn to shine.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Fight With CCG-Style Decks</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181950/extras/EnemyAttackCropped.gif?t=1732263276\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each operator comes with their own deck containing at least 8 signature cards and at least 12 free slots. These resistance fighters are all armed to the teeth: each customisable deck must contain at least 20 cards; and any exposed weaknesses means certain death. To succeed, exploit the synergies between your decks and devise inspired new tactics to defeat your foes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MMO-Inspired Bosses</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181950/extras/BossAttackCropped.gif?t=1732263276\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Engage in combat against multi-phase boss encounters inspired by MMO raid bosses, each with their own exhilarating mechanics and unique abilities. Take on the Siegebreaker, a colossal mech war machine; spill the blood of the Mithraean Bull, a terrible experiment gone awry; or defend a rooftop against a gunship blazing with weapons.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Campaign Mode</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181950/extras/NodeMapCropped.gif?t=1732263276\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Make your way through 3 out of 6+ shattered districts before reaching the culmination of your journey in Wargentin District, the dark heart of the Zerzura Exclusion Zone. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Draft Mode</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181950/extras/ShardsCropped.gif?t=1732263276\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Inspired by drafting formats in CCGs, draft mode starts you off with a veritable arsenal of data shards. Unseal your shards, draft the cards within to create your decks, and then take those decks into battle against an unforgiving gauntlet of randomized, escalating boss encounters. How far can you get before you succumb to the most dangerous enemies in Zerzura?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Meta-progression</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Earn Mnemosynth through your runs, and use these synthetic memories to permanently imprint cards into your collection through the Failsafe system. The added cards can be carried over to the next run, greatly enhancing your deck’s power.</p>"

While medical technology has extended human lifespan, the &quot;aging problem&quot; has become serious. There are too many elderly people, and pensions and health insurance are on the brink of collapse.<br><br>Yes, there are too many elderly people, and the protagonist is a quack doctor. Wise readers will have already guessed the story of this game. However, whether or not you want to address the aging problem is up to you. You can even target rare young patients if you'd like.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">◆Make patients sick with evil medical exams!</h2></li></ul>Use reused syringes, touch patients with unclean hands, perform hearing tests with loud noises, and conduct cursed psychological tests... Use evil medical exams to make patients sick.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">◆Critical quack treatments</h2></li></ul>After making the patient sick, treat them with the appropriate quack treatment. For example, use &quot;lobotomy&quot; on patients with brain problems and &quot;cancer neglect therapy&quot; on cancer patients. Of course, they won't be cured. Use your quack techniques to hit the affected area precisely and finish them off!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">◆Don't let patients escape!</h2></li></ul>If you repeat unpleasant medical procedures, patients will run away. Stop them by knocking them out or tempting them with seduction. Prescribing opioids (narcotic painkillers) can also be effective!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">◆Treatment depends on the patient's financial situation</h2></li></ul>You should be sensitive to the patient's wallet. Even if you provide expensive treatment to a poor person, you won't be able to collect payment. Oh, but don't worry, poor people on welfare are an exception. You can fleece them as much as you want since their medical expenses are covered by public funds!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">◆Prepare for revenge from the bereaved</h2></li></ul>Sometimes, angry relatives will attack you. Use your honed quack techniques to give them all a painless death.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">◆Present at the quack medical society</h2></li></ul>After performing many quack treatments, present your case at the quack medical society and elevate your status as a quack doctor. Various quack doctor jokes will be revealed at the conference. Enjoy the black humor that makes you chuckle and your spine shiver.<br><br><strong>◆This game is a work of fiction, but...</strong><br>This game is a horror-style silly game and has nothing to do with actual illnesses or medical procedures. However, some medical errors are based on real-life examples. <br>Of course, don't imitate any of this, not just the good kids, but doctors as well.<br><br><strong>◆Live streaming is welcome!</strong><br>If there is anyone who would like to provide live streaming, please show us your unique &quot;medical&quot; style, as the way of playing may differ depending on the player.<br>*No slander or disparagement of the work allowed."

It's an interactive sandbox where you get to bully a smart ragdoll. He can stand, tries to balance himself up, fall and get back-up, and is animated by an approximation of a medical system that includes organs.<br><br>You can damage him or play with him, throw him around and more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is this game?</h2>The game is built like small-scope sandbox experimentation tool, inspired by video-game tech demos, centered around experimenting the behaviors of Stanley. Stanley can get balance, receive damage, suffer from concussions and brain damage, break bones, try to get back up (and fail if damaged enough), pass-out from bloodloss... There are 3 maps, and a few tools.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is planned for the future of the game?</h2>I have more ideas for STANDBOX and I hope I can make them happen for the game. That being said, I encourage you to not purchase the game for what it could be but what it is right now. Please only purchase this game if you believe you would be satisfied with a small scope sandbox with a few satisfying behaviors. This is not a huge complex game. This is a very fun physics toy."

Here, there are not only martial skills, but also spiritual energy and technologies that led to the invention of spells and firearms. You will play as Ma Chao, master of a variety of attacks and tools, and break enemy defenses with the help of friends to exact revenge on Cao Cao for slaughtering your family.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/extras/角色选择.gif?t=1733444295\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/extras/SOD-标题-Multiple-Weapons-_-Synergies.png?t=1733444295\" /><br>EXP will be gained from kills for you to level up, unlocking new weapons. Each of the weapons has a unique attack pattern and works best against specific targets. They also have Synergy tags, and activating the same tags grants characters special effects. When you have extra copies of the same weapon, the weapon will be starred up activating its Synergy effects without having to equip the weapon. It is up to you to manage resources for greater combat prowess.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/extras/SOD-图标-EN.png?t=1733444295\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/extras/SOD-来自开发者的话-en.png?t=1733444295\" /><br>It was back when PlayStation 3 was still the latest console, I got obsessed with Drakengard 3. It was the last boss battle, and the rhythm game played to The Final Song by Eir Aoi scarred me permanently and I remembered it to this day. So it began my journey to make a good yet depressing game like Yoko Taro did. Based on this idea, I took elements of Vampire Survivors and Taiko no Tatsujin and added some roguelike and auto battler features to complete this game. As a small segment of the Songs series, the story is relatively independent of the other games, so don't worry if you haven't played the other works in the series. If you are interested in the story, you will need to use different characters to clear the required difficulty levels and stages to unlock each character's story chapters and get a glimpse into the whole story. Hope you all have fun playing!"

Instilling joy and wonder, they provide a unique bond that enables you to utilize their skills for traversing the planet and solving environmental challenges. Once peaceful creatures, they now succumb to an unknown infection driving them to behave aggressively, which makes your mission to save them an urgent necessity.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exploration-driven Gameplay</h2>The gameplay encourages curiosity-driven exploration of its distinct ecosystems—such as the colorful Nari jungle or mysterious Mâruba swamp—creating an interconnected world. With non-aggressive combat mechanics designed for healing rather than defeating and indigenous Flute melodies that you play to tame creatures, the game further highlights the creature-saver nature of the experience.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2304440/extras/AVA_GIF_03_616x260.gif?t=1737382876\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meaningful Narrative</h2>Step into the shoes of Vic, a 22-year-old nature adventurer as she navigates through the immersive expedition alongside Tabitha, a composed and astute researcher.

The game's narrative, co-created by Rhianna Pratchett, is a journey of wonder and mystery but also discovery, leading to the revelation of the planet's captivating secrets.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2304440/extras/AVA_GIF_01_616x260.gif?t=1737382876\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Saving Through Understanding</h2>Creatures of Ava is a game featuring a dense, populated world of rich ecosystems filled with creatures that play a vital role in the planet’s natural balance. It goes beyond traditional creature-related genres, offering a deeper understanding and connection with the things you’ll encounter on Ava. Once you come to understand the true meaning of the infection, you will be challenged to step out of the human-centric point of view and learn about the real toll it takes to preserve the primal beauty at the very roots of Ava.<br><br><strong>After all, can you save something you don't understand?</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2304440/extras/AVA_Steam_Deck_616x260.png?t=1737382876\" />"

Defend Your Legacy. <br><br>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is a full remake of the groundbreaking non-linear RPG Romancing SaGa 2, which originally launched in Japan in 1993.  <br>Embark on an adventure featuring both new and classic SaGa franchise features, complete with Japanese and English voiceovers, original and rearranged compositions, and much more! This is an ideal entry point for new players and provides an amped-up experience for longtime fans.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY </h2>The Seven Heroes were once hailed as saviors, but the ancients feared their power and banished them to another dimension. It was foretold that they would return to save the world once more... <br><br>Thousands of years have passed, and the heroes have become legend. Furious that humankind has forgotten their many sacrifices, they have now returned as villains bent on revenge.  <br><br>As legions of monsters swarm the world, take on the role of Ruler of the Empire of Varennes. Defend your legacy across successive generations, expand your realm and defeat the vengeful Seven Heroes one by one!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES </h2><br><strong><u>Characters &amp; Imperial Succession </u></strong><br>Join forces with characters from over 30 different classes featuring a wide variety of professions and races, each with their own favored weapons, unique abilities, and effective tactics.

Enjoy all the classic SaGa mechanics like &quot;Glimmers,&quot; where you learn new abilities whilst in the heat of battle, and &quot;Formations,&quot; which provide unique benefits to the retinue based on composition. Furthermore, the remake welcomes the new &quot;United Attack&quot; feature to perform combination attacks with your retinue members to turn the tide of battle!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2455640/extras/Brutus_Combat_optimize.gif?t=1732261750\" /><br> <br><strong><u>Graphics </u></strong><br>The 2D pixel sprites of the original game are now modeled in full 3D while retaining their charming, familiar appearances based on the beautiful concept illustrations by Tomomi Kobayashi. All towns and dungeons are now also fully rendered with reworked terrains and layouts.<br> <br><strong><u>Difficulty Settings </u></strong><br>Select from one of three difficulty levels to match your preferred playstyle, from Casual, Normal, to Hard (Classic). <br>Casual offers a story-focused experience with less emphasis on battle, while Normal is recommended for veteran RPG players looking for a balanced game. Hard (Classic) is perfect for players looking for the brutal but satisfying challenge of the original 1993 version.<br><br><strong><u>Music &amp; Voices </u></strong><br>Kenji Ito, the composer for the original Romancing SaGa 2, returns with a vengeance to present a beautiful soundtrack full of new arrangements! The music can be toggled between the original and new versions from the Options screen.<br>Furthermore, all event scenes in Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven now feature full Japanese and English voice acting!"

By extracting and consuming its rich essence, Manari's ninjutsu also grows stronger, giving her the ability to battle stronger demons.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Follow Manami and Agu as they cleanse the world, one demon at a time! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460070/extras/NJ.gif?t=1737047212\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460070/extras/t2.png?t=1737047212\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Manari (Normal)</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460070/extras/c1.png?t=1737047212\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Manari (Demon Ghost Armor)</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460070/extras/c2.png?t=1737047212\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Yutaka - A helpful senpai</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460070/extras/c3.png?t=1737047212\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Demon of Lust</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460070/extras/c4.png?t=1737047212\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Demon of Wrath</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460070/extras/c6.png?t=1737047212\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Demon of Ignorance</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460070/extras/c5.png?t=1737047212\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460070/extras/t3.png?t=1737047212\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Experiment with multiple schools of Ninjutsu!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Create unique builds by strategically choosing cards and talismans that suit your play style!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460070/extras/g1.gif?t=1737047212\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Experience a living ninja drama!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore a Japanese-style map with random battles, treasure, stores, rest areas and a plethora of events!

Despite our passion for the game, our lack of experience led us to blindly embark on a project of significant scale. Like blind men feeling an elephant, we learned and created simultaneously, encountering numerous challenges along the way. Many envisioned features proved unattainable, but fortunately, we managed to bring the game to completion.<br><br>Due to our limited experience in various aspects such as combat, art, and level design, Our game does have some issues. It may not ultimately become a masterpiece that satisfies all players, but for us, the official launch of this work is a milestone achievement.<br><br>We sincerely thank players for your support and expectations. We are grateful for your companionship along this journey and are committed to continuing our efforts, striving not to disappoint your expectations.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty is a 3D action game inspired by traditional Chinese landscape ink paintings.</h2>You take on the role of a Qi army soldier, tasked with fighting back the Japanese pirate raids during the Ming Dynasty. After your unit's boat shipwrecks, you find yourself cast on an island controlled by the Wokou, Japanese pirates that have been terrorizing the Chinese coasts for decades. You are alone with your sword, the last soldier of the Ming Dynasty standing against the pirates – but your duty won't be fulfilled until your people's coasts are safe again. <br><br>Explore the beautifully painted landscapes of Fuling Island to defeat the 5 pirate bosses, each with their own unique characteristics, experiencing the most intense traditional melee combat. Embrace the challenge of this hardcore action game, rich in historical charm and martial arts depth!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2494450/extras/3月25日202441711414219.gif?t=1726023806\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fighting against Japanese pirates</h2>The Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty is set during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. At that time, rampant Japanese pirates plagued the southeastern coastal regions. General Qi Jiguang was tasked with combating these pirates; after successfully finishing his campaign, he headed north to Jizhou, pacifying internal rebellions in his path and guarding against external barbarians. But as the Qi's army moved north, the remnants of the defeated Japanese pirates gathered back its forces and conspired with other sea raiders from Fuling Island, readying to make a bloody comeback.<br><br>As a member of the Qi's army stationed to guard the coastal regions, specifically tasked with pacifying the seas, you were patrolling the waters when a storm shipwrecked your boat – and you find yourself a castaway on the shores of Ryukyu Island, the only survivor of your unit. With your sword by your side, you walk into the depths of the Island, set on uncovering and dismantling the clandestine plots of the Japanese pirates.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2494450/extras/3月29日_1_20244171138315.gif?t=1726023806\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ink and wash painting world</h2>The game's art is inspired by traditional Chinese ink and wash paintings.

Its combat system is built upon three basic attack actions: stab, cleave, and sweep, which form the basis of both offense and defense. While executing these moves, it is crucial to discern the enemy's attacks simultaneously. You can deflect their attacks by accurately anticipating the enemy's actions. Stay calm in the midst of the storm while you ponder the enemy's every move, and you will remain undefeated in battle.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2494450/extras/3月29日_1_202441711371114.gif?t=1726023806\" /><br><br>The game offers a variety of combat styles, ranging from close-quarters melee weapons to long-range bows and arrows. You can either block enemy attacks with your weapons or utilize evading maneuvers and counterattacks. The key to overcoming adversaries lies in swiftly switching between offense and defense, adeptly countering their moves. Only by mastering the art of adaptation and switching styles you will ultimately triumph over your foes.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2494450/extras/4月3日_1_202441711392817.gif?t=1726023806\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Historical weaponry and armor</h2>The game offers a variety of weapons and equipment for players to choose from.

You have to climb up to the sky, overcoming various platforms and objects to uncover the mystery of this puzzling world. Play alone or with friends, because it's always more fun together. Compete, co-operate and overcome all obstacles together, climbing to the top. You will find entertaining Easter eggs and references along the way. Be cautious and alert, because every item may turn out to be unpredictable, even if it behaved differently before. The absence of a save function adds to the difficulty of getting through the game. You won't get a second chance. Even the slightest wrong step can send you back to the very beginning.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Sometimes it can be difficult for children to realise how wide the world outside their home is. Find out what lies beyond the fence of their junkyard and feel the world inviting you to explore it!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Like fledglings leaving their nests, you will need courage and perseverance to overcome your fears and reach your goals.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The world, my friend, is far from paradise or a walk in a sunny meadow. It is a dangerous and steep place where, if you give in for even a moment, it will knock you down with such a bang that you will never rise again. No one on this earth gives such a slap as life does. It's important to take the blow from fate and get up. If you intend to keep going, don't give up halfway through. That is how victory is won, no matter the odds!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2500750/extras/handup.gif?t=1729966171\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">No matter what happens, you must learn from your mistakes, but remember, this crazy world does not forgive missteps!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">And remember, there are no wrong roads, this is the way!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Our game is inspired by stories of people who don't give up. It may take forever to list them, but most importantly, remember that you are one of them too!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game will show you what you are capable of. However, there are not only challenges in the game, but also things that will make you smile!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you have already realised, this game is about overcoming yourself and defeating your own limitations. There are no saves here, we don't do that!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Keep your eyes open, as around every corner you may encounter hidden and secret dumpsters, which you can use to jump high to the sky. Dumpsters help in speeding up the game's progression.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Use the lifts to go up to other higher levels of the location.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2500750/extras/multiplayer_600_type2.png?t=1729966171\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2500750/extras/multiplayer_zip.gif?t=1729966171\" />Whether you choose multiplayer mode or prefer to experience it alone, Only Climb: Better Together offers you unforgettable adventures, friendly competition and the possibility to create your own team of up to 8 people to overcome all obstacles and reach the top of success together.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2500750/extras/key_mechanics_600_type2.png?t=1729966171\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2500750/extras/jumper.gif?t=1729966171\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Dumpsters are trampolines to climb higher and higher on the levels of the location.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2500750/extras/lifts.gif?t=1729966171\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Lifts to move around the location.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2500750/extras/daynight.gif?t=1729966171\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- The changing cycle of day and night</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2500750/extras/push.gif?t=1729966171\" />- The ability to push other players lets you prevent them from progressing through the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Players can play together with friends or alone.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- An option to gather a team of friends up to 8 people.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the game, you will enjoy the option to assemble a team of your friends and face challenges together.

        "Description": "One could say POOLS is like an art gallery where you look around and listen to the sounds. There are very few things to solve, practically a few mazes. Sometimes the game can challenge your navigation skills. But mostly you're just... there.<br><br>Note: There are no monsters chasing you or jumping suddenly towards you, but the game can feel oppressive. POOLS plays on fears of getting lost, the dark, and tight spaces.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2663530/extras/2.jpg?t=1732783506\" /><br><br>The game has no user-interface and no dialogue. No background music. Instead, the game uses sounds to make you feel like you're really there. The sounds and echo change depending on the room you're in. Walking in water is slower. All of these things makes the game feel more real and creates a tense atmosphere.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2663530/extras/gif-0.gif?t=1732783506\" /><br><br>There's no typical story, no characters to meet, and you won't find any notes in game. But as you explore and advance further, you start to notice that the game's world changes around you. Rooms look and feel different. Each chapter has something unique. Constantly you're exploring new places, each with its own kind of mystery.<br><br>POOLS has six unique chapters, each taking 10 to 30 minutes to play.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2663530/extras/steam-banner-1.png?t=1732783506\" /><br><br>POOLS is inspired by a internet phenomenons &quot;<strong>Liminal spaces</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>Found footage</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Backrooms</strong>&quot; - specifically &quot;<strong>Backrooms Pools</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>Poolrooms</strong>&quot;.<br><br>One of the original artists behind the Poolrooms concept is <strong>Jared Pike</strong>.<br><br>Other inspirations include:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Matt Studios</strong>: Poolrooms videos from 2022<br></li><li><strong>Mortain Colors</strong><br></li><li><strong>Anemoiapolis: Chapter 1</strong> by Andrew Quist<br></li><li><strong>Kane Pixels</strong>: The Backrooms (Found Footage)</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2663530/extras/1.jpg?t=1732783506\" />"

        "Description": "<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Path of Exile 2 is a next generation Action RPG from Grinding Gear Games, featuring co-op for up to six players. Path of Exile 2 takes place in the land of Wraeclast, a dark continent populated by unique cultures, ancient secrets, and monstrous dangers. A sinister threat, long thought destroyed, has begun creeping back on the edge of civilisation, driving people mad and sickening the land with Corruption. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Path of Exile 2 features a brand new campaign with six acts, 100 distinct environments, 600 monsters and 100 bosses.   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2694490/extras/Combat1.gif?t=1736126604\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Twelve Character Classes</strong><br>Path of Exile 2 features twelve character classes, two for every combination of Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. While each of the class variants focuses on a different playstyle, they're just a starting point. You can combine skills from many classes together to create your ideal character build.<br><br>Each of the twelve character classes has its own three Ascendancy specialisations, resulting in a total of 36 Ascendancy Classes to pick between.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2694490/extras/Combat2_New.gif?t=1736126604\" /></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>New Skill Gem System</strong><br>Path of Exile 2 features 240 Skill Gems that grant devastating active skills and 200 Support Gems that modify their behaviour. Combine these together to create your perfect build.<br><br>This is the next generation of Path of Exile's famous skill system. Support Gems are now socketed directly into Skill Gems, removing many of the frustrations present in the old system while maintaining all the previous depth. It's now possible to six-link every skill your character uses.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Dual-specialise your Passive Skill Tree</strong><br>Path of Exile's iconic Passive Skill Tree has made a return, with 1,500 skills that allow you to completely customise your gameplay experience. It now features Dual Specialisation, the ability to allocate some passive skill points to two different sets of skills. They engage whenever the appropriate weapon or skill type is used. For example, you can have some points allocated to both daggers and traps, or ice and lightning, and as you swap between attacks, the appropriate skill points will apply. This lets you specialise in multiple areas without opportunity cost.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2694490/extras/DuelSpec.gif?t=1736126604\" /></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Uncover All-new Items</strong><br>Path of Exile 2 features 700 equipment base types and every single one has its own unique item you can find. You can augment your arsenal with new weapons such as Spears, Crossbows and Flails, as well as supplementary items like Focuses, Traps and redesigned Sceptres.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Encounter Unique Bosses</strong><br>In Path of Exile 2, every area of the Campaign contains a boss encounter. There's over a hundred bosses to fight as you make your way through the Acts and they all have unique mechanics to learn. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2694490/extras/Atlas.gif?t=1736126604\" /></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Explore a New Endgame <br> </strong>Completing the campaign is just the beginning. The endgame in Path of Exile 2 includes countless areas in different biomes, powerful crafting, challenging bosses, unique encounters and much more. Unlock new paths and explore further into the world.  <br><br> As you progress through the endgame, you will gain access to special passive trees that can boost the rewards of your maps and change the way the various endgame mechanics work. These trees will make your maps more rewarding but also more difficult.<br> <br>Path of Exile 2 introduces sequels to several leagues from Path of Exile. While their mechanics are familiar, the monsters, bosses, rewards and progression are all new.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Fair-To-Play. Never Pay-To-Win. </strong><br>Path of Exile 2 is a separate game to the original Path of Exile. We will continue to offer expansions for both games going forward. They  will never be &quot;pay to win&quot;. Purchases are shared between the two games.</p></li></ul>"

Of course, you can manage the entire process alone, but it's always funnier with friends trolling you. (Well, not pretty sure about this one.) One of you is CEO, and s/he has the control over your authorization. So, if you cannot purchase land or take a loan from a bank, it's best to talk to your CEO before writing your totally kind wishes on our Discord server.

Rooftops &amp; Alleys is a brand new game being developed by a single person in Unreal Engine 5. <strong>RNA</strong> has been in development for around 12-13 months and is ongoing. This project aims to create a fun single-player experience with multiple maps to free roam and challenge yourself in.

        "Description": "A total of 55 different officers are featured in this rich depiction of the Warring States period. The new deluxe edition of &quot;SAMURAI WARRIORS 4&quot; contains more than 150 previously released DLC, including costumes, weapons, customization parts, scenarios, BGM, and more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">• Interact with 55 different officers, including Nobuyuki Sanada and Yoshitsugu Otani!</h2>In response to popular demand, Nobuyuki Sanada and Yoshitsugu Otani are now among the many officers featured in this vivid portrayal of the Warring States period. Takatora Todo, Naotora Ii, and Munenori Yagyu, who previously appeared only in Japanese releases, also appear for the first time in the main &quot;SAMURAI WARRIORS&quot; series. In addition, character designs have been revamped and action elements have been enhanced for fan-favorite characters like Yukimura Sanada and Nobunaga Oda. The range of 55 unique officers, the greatest number of officers in a single game in the series, is a key component of &quot;SAMURAI WARRIORS.&quot;<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2719200/extras/Nobuyuki_Screenshot.png?t=1729049924\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">• Journey through the colorful history of the Warring States period!</h2>In the main Story Mode, a tale based on historical events unfolds in two separate parts. While the regional stories focus on officers from regions across the land, such as Kyushu and Shikoku, the story of unification details the events leading up to the end of the Warring States period. Unlike previous &quot;SAMURAI WARRIORS&quot; titles, this game features battles between each faction, allowing for a more dramatic depiction of the relationships between officers. Experience firsthand the convictions, conflicts, and complex feelings of these officers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">• Experience the most exhilarating action in the entire series!</h2>The true thrill of this series, mowing down hordes of enemies in battles of 1 vs. 1,000, has been made even more exhilarating with the addition of new elements, including Hyper Attacks, which allow players to quickly close in on their enemies and cut them down, and Rage mode, which powers up attacks when the Spirit Gauge is full and allows players to perform the ultimate finishing move: Musou Frenzy Attacks. In addition, characters' attack types and the overall progression system have been revamped. These new elements offer an unprecedented variety of attacks, along with the strongest sense of exhilaration of any game in the series, all while maintaining the simple controls characteristic of the &quot;WARRIORS&quot; series.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2719200/extras/Yukimura_Screenshot.png?t=1729049924\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">• Travel across the land in Chronicle Mode!</h2>Explore the world of &quot;SAMURAI WARRIORS&quot; in the new Chronicle Mode by completing various types of requests, meeting officers, and collecting items in regions across the land. Leave a lasting mark on the history of the Warring States period by customizing officers via Create Character in the upgraded editing mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">• Switch between characters in real time during battle!</h2>Use the Switch Character feature to switch between two different characters on the battlefield in real time as they strive for victory. By switching characters, players can gain an advantage in battle, discover hidden objectives, and receive various benefits. They can also set a detailed plan of action for the character not currently being played.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">• Utilize the strong connection between Morale and combat!</h2>Enemy camps are made stronger by higher Morale levels, but completing objectives and defeating standard bearers lowers enemy Morale and makes it easier to claim victory. As such, the player's actions have a drastic effect on battle conditions."

Any feedback is welcome to help us improve, even for future games that are on the way!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2785200/extras/raptor.png?t=1734617246\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You are the prey</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unknown Tapes is a horror video game that employs the <strong>found footage</strong> technique to narrate a <strong>story</strong> focused on survival in a modern setting overrun by dinosaurs. It aims for <strong>realism</strong> and draws inspiration from <strong>Dino Crisis and Outlast</strong>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A <strong>story</strong> will unfold, with an expected playtime of 2-3 hours from start to finish</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You are being <strong>hunted</strong> by dinosaurs, and you will need to hide, avoid making too much noise, and sometimes use your wits.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Buildings can be destroyed</strong> by larger dinosaurs, so you can't always count on finding protection inside.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game is primarily set at night, featuring both outdoor and indoor environments, some of which may feel claustrophobic.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An Infested Urban World</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Thanks to photogrammetry and the graphical power of Unreal Engine 5, we’ve recreated detailed urban environments.

Your purchase of the game covers these costs up to the amount you paid for the game. Beyond that, to manage additional costs, I've introduced an in-game currency called tokens.

Without the compromise of having tokens to offset these costs, the game would need to be priced higher than AAA titles to be commercially viable over the long-term.<br><br><strong>If you run out of tokens, you will automatically receive 10,000 tokens for free each day</strong>. If you wish to bypass the token system entirely, you can provide your own API keys, switch to free AI models in the settings, or install the AI models locally from the Steam Workshop.</i>"

Featuring photorealistic graphics, fully dynamic scares and microphone detection.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>How Do I Play?</strong></h2><strong>You find yourself in the middle of a mysterious forest. Your goal is to find people who have previously gotten lost in the forest. You must be <u>SILENT</u> at night because the forest is listening to your voice through your <u>microphone</u> as you explore. It tries to make you <u>SCREAM</u> with various jumpscares. When you scream, you get one step closer to losing. You also have to constantly check your surroundings because real threats that are trying to hunt you down are on your tail. You lose when you scream or get caught by threats, and the game restarts, but this time the locations of the previously found lost people have also changed. You can't even predict what fear the game will throw at you at any given time because the whole process is <u>randomized</u>.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><i></i><li> <strong><i>Microphone Detection</i></strong><br></li><li> <strong><i>Unpredictable FULL Dynamic Jumpscares</i></strong><br></li><li> <strong><i>Found-Footage - VHS Style Graphics</i></strong><br></li><li> <strong><i>Different AI's Hunting You Down</i></strong><br></li><li> <strong><i>Photorealistic Environment</i></strong><br></li><li> <strong><i>Huge Forest with Different Locations in Every Direction</i></strong><br></li><li> <strong><i>Replayability (Scares and missing person locations are dynamically randomized every playthrough, making each playthrough a unique experience.)</i></strong></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Lore</strong></h2><strong><i>After a night you can't remember, you find yourself at a familiar-looking crime scene.

        "Description": "The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™ follows the Dwarves as they embark on a new adventure to reclaim their legendary home of Moria beneath the Misty Mountains. Players will join forces to survive, craft, build and explore the iconic, sprawling mines. Courageous expeditioners will need to be vigilant as mysterious dangers await. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2933130/extras/RtM-GIF-Explore-620x200.gif?t=1734669069\" /><br><br>Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven homeland of Moria—known as Khazad-dûm or Dwarrowdelf—in the depths below their very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of Moria to recover its treasures. <br><br>Set in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or co-op online with companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the dangers below: where there’s clatter, there’s combat. Excavate the mysteries of legendary mountains, extract precious metals, scrape to survive, and battle unspeakable forces to learn the secret of the Shadow that lurks within.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>KEY GAME FEATURES</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2933130/extras/RtM-GIF-Building-620x200.gif?t=1734669069\" /><br>• <strong>Rebuild and Reshape Moria:</strong> Restore the long-lost ancient kingdom of Khazad-dûm to its former glory, recovering Dwarven landmarks as the story progresses. Resurrect old mines and refire their forges to yield their untouched resources. <br>• <strong>Explore: </strong>Delve into the depths of the Mines of Moria. Procedurally generated environments are abundant with resources and fraught with mystery and danger, providing a unique experience each and every time. <br>• <strong>Base Building:</strong> Find solace from the darkness. Reveal and clear new locations to create architecture on a grand scale. Get creative and construct bases from scratch or build upon the existing environment. Beware the evils which seek to destroy Dwarven progress. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2933130/extras/RtM-GIF-Social-620x200.gif?t=1734669069\" /><br>• <strong>Co-op Multiplayer: </strong>Adventure alone or band together with friends in online cooperative multiplayer. <br>• <strong>Survive the Dark:</strong> To survive the treacherous Mines of Moria players must conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature and noise levels. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain. <br>• <strong>Craft Dwarven Tools, Weapons and More:</strong> Craft and loot legendary Dwarven armor, tools, weapons and structures. Rebuild ancient forges to strengthen, repair and enchant gear. Upgrade and unlock new technologies and fantastical machines. <br>• <strong>Mine Ore and Jewels:</strong> Establish mines to unearth deposits of precious resources such as iron, gold, and quartz; and fantastical materials such as Mithril. Access crafting stations and forges to convert ore to ingots and upgrade gear. But be prepared, mining is loud and can awaken what lurks in the darkness. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2933130/extras/RtM-GIF-Combat-620x200.gif?t=1734669069\" /><br>• <strong>Uncover Magic Artifacts: </strong>Discover ancient magic items including swords that glow when Orcs are near, maps of long-dormant Mithril veins, books with forgotten crafting plans and amulets that give strength or wisdom. <br>• <strong>Feel the Fellowship:</strong> Experience the Fellowship of the Dwarves like never before, with the rich lore of the iconic fantasy world from J.R.R. Tolkien interwoven into the very fabric of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. <br>• <strong>Comprehensive Dwarf Builder:</strong> Players become part of Dwarven Legend as they create their own Dwarf in the custom character creator. Dwarves can be customized in a variety of ways to create a unique Dwarven identity. During gameplay, players can find and craft armor and weapons to further enhance their unique style."

    "Description": "In Stonehearth, you pioneer a living world full of warmth, heroism, and mystery. Help a small group of settlers build a home for themselves in a forgotten land. You\u2019ll need to establish a food supply, build shelter, defend your people, monitor their moods, and find a way to grow and expand, facing challenges at every step. <br><br>Starting from procedurally generated terrain with dynamic AI encounters, Stonehearth combines community management and combat with infinite building possibilities. It\u2019s designed to be moddable at every level, from your city to the people and creatures inhabiting the world, and will ship with the tools and documentation for you to add your own customizations to the game, and share them with friends.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build and Grow Your City</h2><br>The heart of the game is city building and management. When you're just starting out, you'll need to juggle tasks like obtaining a sustainable food supply, building shelter, and defending your fledgling settlement from raiders and other threats. <br><br>Once you've achieved a foothold in the world, it's up to you to write the destiny for your people. You have the flexibility to choose your own path in this game. Do you want to build a great conquering empire? A vibrant trade city? A spiritual monastery? We really want you to feel like this is your settlement, and give you the tools that make it look and operate exactly as you wish.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Level Up Your Settlers</h2><br>All the settlers in your towns have jobs. A job is like a class in a role playing game. Each job has a specific role like hauling materials, building, crafting, and fighting. As your hearthlings work at a job they will gain experience and levels. Some jobs, when they meet certain prerequisites, can upgrade to entirely new jobs with new capabilities.<br><br>Usually, to assign someone a new job you'll also need to craft a tool for them. The Mason can craft blocks, statues, and tools from stone, but to do it he'll need a mallet and chisel crafted by the carpenter. Our goal is to have a job tree that's both very wide and very deep, so there will be plenty of different kinds of things to do in the game, but also a lot of depth to explore if you want to concentrate on any one area.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Player Driven Legacy Through Modding</h2><br>We LOVE mods and want to make it as easy as possible to author and share mods. <br><br>Want to see a new kind of sword in the game? You can model it, define its stats, and then craft it in game. You can also share the design with other players so they can enjoy it too, or bring their authored content into your game. <br><br>As a modder you\u2019ll be able to do basically anything that we as developers can do: introduce new items and monsters, write new scripted adventures, influence the AI, you name it. It goes back to that original pen and paper RPG experience, where \u201cthe game\u201d is a collaboration between the core ruleset and the stories crafted by the gamemaster."

    "Description": "<strong>NoLimits 2</strong> is the ultimate roller coaster simulation that lets you experience authentic roller coaster thrills. Climb into the world's most famous roller coasters and experience the excitement in real time. Or design a new roller coaster that is engineered to your specifications. <br><br>Use a full-featured roller coaster editor with a CAD-style wire-frame display to build a custom coaster. Drag and drop track, supporting structures, and other objects. Use slider bars to change the perspective of the elements being designed, and to zoom in and out. Your only constraints are the laws of physics and your imagination. <br><br>After you have designed and constructed your roller coaster, <strong>NoLimits 2</strong> serves up a real-time roller coaster experience, from the time the train chugs its way up the first slope, to the time it stops to a stop on the exit platform. The simulation includes the sounds of the wind rushing by, and the metal-on-metal sounds that are integral to enjoying a coaster ride. It's easy to choose any seat on any car in the coaster train. Use the computer's mouse to change the line of sight and angle of vision. <br><br><strong>NoLimits 2</strong> is the world's most comprehensive roller coaster simulation, with results so realistic that professional designers like <i>John Wardley</i> use <strong>NoLimits 2</strong> to create and test designs for physical roller coasters.

For this reason we decided to give you the possibility to <strong>get the soundtracks on your own devices and listen to them more often</strong> than while sniping in Georgia.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Composed and produced by <strong>Mikolai Stroinski </strong>(The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt \u2013 Blood and Wine, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Detached, Kursk), mixed by <strong>Steve Kempster</strong> and recorded by <strong>Tony Phillips</strong> at <strong>Beautiful Noise Studios in Los Angeles</strong>, each artist was invited to the studio to provide his or her own element to the overall score. Some instruments used that may be familiar to a Western audience include drum, bass, synthesizer, guitar and vocals; but, there\u2019s also the use of mandolin, balalaika and bandura.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Artists involved include:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf\tVocals - Aurelia Shrenker</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf\tGuitars, Balalaika, Bandura, Mandolin - George Bernhardt</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf\tSynthesizers - Mikolai Stroinski</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf\tBass - Paul Bushnell</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf\tDrum Set - Joel Taylor </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Some songs on the soundtrack have a noticeable Georgian touch to them, and a fair amount of Sniper Ghost Warrior 3\u2019s score is<strong> inspired by various folk and pop music</strong> researched prior to the pre-production of the game score. The goal in mind for the <strong>Georgian-influenced songs</strong> are to enhance the player\u2019s emotions and to emphasize the location in Georgia while also leaving the location to be painted by other elements in the game such as the graphics and dialogue. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/368070/extras/soundtrack-min.png?t=1728377817\" /></p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 tells the story of brotherhood, faith and betrayal in the most complete sniper experience ever. Take the role of an American sniper named Jonathan North, who is dropped into enemy territory in northern Georgia, nearby Russian borders. Explore large open-world maps with dynamic weather and a day and night cycle that actually impacts play and decisions. Customize weapon equipment, accessories, vehicles and a drone, and utilize the three pillars of gameplay to your liking: Sniper, Ghost and Warrior.<br><br>Go behind enemy lines with the ultimate modern military shooter. Play as an American sniper dropped in Georgia, near Russian border. Choose your own path to accomplish your missions across an unforgiving open world.<br><br><strong>Be a Sniper:</strong> Engage your targets from the long range.

To separate truth from illusion. To make sense of their own lives.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Steam version of SeaBed has been updated to natively support 1440x1080 resolution.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Characters:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/583090/extras/SB-Gif1.gif?t=1732731242\" /><i>&quot;At times, I'd wake up at night and hear all the sounds around me as if they were amplified.

Although Sachiko used to be quite an avid reader during her school years, finding a job means she now only opens a book every once in a while, whenever her schedule allows it. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After meeting Takako \u2013 an inexhaustible source of enthusiasm, as well as a stark contrast to her own personality \u2013 during her childhood years, Sachiko\u2019s interests began to shift to whatever the other woman was doing at a given time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/583090/extras/SB-Gif2.gif?t=1732731242\" /><i>&quot;This is as good a time as any, so let's check it out.&quot;</i> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Endlessly interested in and enthusiastic about the world, Takako gives the impression of a woman perpetually stuck in her childhood. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">She fell in love with Sachiko at first sight back when they first met at the age of five. However, she does not identify as a homosexual, stressing that Sachiko simply happened to be a woman. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Takako discovers that she suffers from developmental amnesia, a condition that severely impairs her ability to recall many of her memories.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/583090/extras/SB-Gif3.gif?t=1732731242\" /><i>&quot;I just like observing people.&quot; </i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A psychiatrist at Narasaki Mental Clinic.

    "Description": "<h1>Language Packs</h1><p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Although during the game's development only English and Spanish are officially supported, the game has support for <strong>community translations</strong>. Check out the <strong>Steam Workshop</strong> to see the available language packs created by other players!</p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Grey Hack is a massively multiplayer hacking simulator game.<br><br>You're a hacker with full freedom to act as you wish on a vast network of procedurally generated computers.<br><br>File Explorer, Terminal and Text Editor are some of the programs that will be available from the start of the game. As you improve your skills you will find new utilities that you may install and use.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/605230/extras/anim01c.gif?t=1737536381\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A living persistent world</h2>Explore the Grey Hack universe and forge your own reputation in a world shared by all players. When you leave the game, <strong>the online universe remains actively running 24/7</strong>.<br><br>This always active game session means that the changes you have made in any computer in the world can be seen by players who connect to them even if you are no longer online. Your progress will be saved, but your actions may have consequences.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plan your attacks</h2>Each network in the world has a totally different configuration, size and security, also using a dynamic and deep exploit system so that each network and computer poses a different challenge. Study your target; use social engineering, scan the system for administrator flaws that allow a backdoor to be opened, test different possible exploits, but above all, cover your tracks when you're done.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Create, modify, share</h2>The terminal has a fundamental role, based on real UNIX commands; it is an indispensable tool for carrying out successful attacks.<br><br>Terminal commands and exploits have been built using the scripting language available in the game, this means that you can modify any existing command or create your own if you wish. In the same way you can create your own exploits if the ones that are already available in the world do not satisfy your needs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sandbox</h2>Grey Hack offers a non-linear experience where you progress at your own pace. Publish web pages to share your creations, create guilds and organize attacks against other players, carry out commissioned missions to earn money and reputation, or explore the world on your own where special missions and other secrets are hidden.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Single Player Mode</h2>Grey Hack is intended to be played in Multiplayer Mode, benefiting from the richer environment of an always-online universe, but the game also offers a single player mode for those so inclined. In Single Player mode, you play in a world created on your computer. Unlike Online Mode, when you exit the game in Single Player, the in-game universe stops, and progress resumes only upon your return.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Roadmap</h2>Grey Hack is in the Alpha phase version 0.8. You can check the roadmap on the game's Steam forum. I am open for suggestions, if there is any feature you would like to see in the game, do not hesitate to let me know through the Steam forums or Discord."

You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion.

There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861650/extras/SESS_GIF_03_VideoTape.gif?t=1734627429\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861650/extras/EN_3.png?t=1734627429\" /><br><br>Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen\u2026 In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861650/extras/SESS_GIF_04_CustomSkate.gif?t=1734627429\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861650/extras/EN_4.png?t=1734627429\" /><br><br>Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard.
